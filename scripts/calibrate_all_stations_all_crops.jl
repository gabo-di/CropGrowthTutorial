"""
    We make the crop calibration for all the crops and all the stations

    Note:
    1. Some stations do not have enough phenology data to calibrate the phenology
    1. Some stations do not have yield/biomass data

    If we only have full data for a given crop in a given station we do the full calibration
    If we only have enough data for the phenology calibration we only do this
    If we do not have enough data for anything we skip the crop
    
    Results of crop calibration are on `data/sims`
